We'll write [blog posts](http://buncha-nerds.com/blog) about all of these things so you can learn too!

### Who we are

We're just a Buncha Nerds who all happen to be [BU Engineering](https://bu.edu/eng) alumni!

* [Alex](http://alexwong.me) works at [GE Digital](https://ge.com/digital) in the Software Development Leadership Program. When not coding, he's a die-hard [BU Hockey](https://twitter.com/TerrierHockey) fan, an avid hockey player, and also like to play video games. He's kinda like that guy in the new [GE commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpDIEJrog3s), but not really.
